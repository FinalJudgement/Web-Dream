            <h1>Pay and Benefits</h1>
            <p>Web development can be a very satisfying career choice. One of the things that matters the most is
                our compensation. What is the pay like? And what are the benefits?
            </p>
            <div style="display:flex; justify-content: space-between;">
                <p style="margin-top:20px; margin-right: 20px;">According to Occupational Outlook Handbook, in 2021
                    the median annual wage for a web developer was $77,450, with the lower 10 percent making around
                    $38,550, and the upper 10 percent making around $168,200.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With that being said, some may be concerned about the 38,500 minimum salaries, but this isn't
                    typical, and there could be many reasons why the wage is low. One of my favorite things about web
                    development is the vast opportunities that workers have to improve and fill more senior positions,
                    or the freedom to change to a company that suits them better.

                It's difficult to quantify the benefits of being a web developer due to every company being different.
                However, there are some common benefits that we can see through web developer careers in general.
                <br>
                <br>
                These Benefits include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working Remotely</li>
                <li>High Potential for Creativity</li>
                <li>Working and Traveling</li>
                <li>Freelancing</li>
                <li>Career Growth</li>
                <li>Pay</li>
                <li>Transferrable Skills(into other programming jobs)</li>
                <li>No Degree Required</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Also, if you happen to land a job at a big tech company, you could see much more benefits, including free
                meals, free commutes, and even free housing. One of the most important things to note is that employees
                that are web developers enjoy their freedoms and life styles. And if you enjoy your work, then you never
                feel like you're working at all. This is why I want to become a Web Developer.</p>
